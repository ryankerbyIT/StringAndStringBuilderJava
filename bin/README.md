# StringBuilder and String Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates various string manipulation techniques in Java, including the use of `StringBuilder`, `String` objects, and other related string-processing tasks. It contains multiple classes to showcase different operations, such as searching, formatting, analyzing, and reading strings from files.

## Overview

This Java project explores different methods for handling and processing strings using `String` and `StringBuilder` classes. The exercises include:
- Performing operations such as string splitting and analysis.
- Searching and formatting strings.
- Using data from text and CSV files to perform calculations and manipulations.
- Working with phone numbers and analyzing grades from external files.

## Classes

### 1. `CharacterTest`
- **Description**: Demonstrates various character and string methods, including validation, conversion, and manipulation.

### 2. `CircleArea`
- **Description**: Contains methods to calculate the area of a circle, possibly as part of formatting and outputting the results in string format.

### 3. `CustomerNumber`
- **Description**: A class that could handle customer information, possibly using strings to validate or format customer numbers.

### 4. `PersonSearch`
- **Description**: Provides functionality to search for a person within a dataset, likely using string comparison techniques.

### 5. `SplitDemo1`, `SplitDemo2`, `SplitDemo3`, `SplitDemo4`
- **Description**: A series of classes demonstrating different ways to split and manipulate strings using Java's built-in methods. This includes breaking strings into substrings using delimiters and exploring how to handle various edge cases.

### 6. `StringAnalyzer`
- **Description**: Analyzes strings to extract specific information, possibly including counts of certain characters or words.

### 7. `Telephone` and `TelephoneTester`
- **Description**: Contains classes for formatting and validating telephone numbers, using strings for manipulation and output.

### 8. `TestAverages`
- **Description**: Uses strings to read numerical data (likely test scores) from an external file and compute averages.

### 9. `TestScoreReader`
- **Description**: Reads test scores from a text or CSV file, using string parsing techniques to extract and process the data.

## Data Files

The project includes several data files used by different classes:

- **`GasPrices.txt`**: Text file likely used for reading and processing gas price data.
- **`Grades.csv`**: CSV file containing student grades for analysis and processing.
- **`pbnumbers.txt`**: Contains phone numbers, possibly used by the `Telephone` and `TelephoneTester` classes.
- **`SalesData.txt`**: Text file containing sales data, potentially used for string manipulation or parsing exercises.

## Usage

1. **String Splitting**: Explore various methods for splitting strings with the `SplitDemo` classes.
2. **String Analysis**: Use `StringAnalyzer` to process and analyze strings, extracting useful information.
3. **File Reading and Processing**: Utilize classes like `TestScoreReader` to read data from external files and manipulate it as strings.
4. **StringBuilder**: In cases where string concatenation is performed repeatedly, explore the use of `StringBuilder` for efficient processing.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code for running and testing the classes.
